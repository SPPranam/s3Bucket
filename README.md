During my internship at @Tangent Cloud, I gained hands-on experience with cloud services including S3, EC2, Cloud9, and message queues. As part of my training, I developed a web page that integrates with AWS S3 to store user-entered data. The application generates a temporary link, valid for 60 seconds, to access the stored data. This project was accomplished with the support and training from the Tangent Cloud team, enhancing my skills in cloud-based solutions.
